## Usage

Download and unzip into the "Music" folder of the HVSC. Run it and it will generate a "C64.html" file in the same folder. Most browsers will opt to download the sid files, however at least Firefox will prompt to download or open in sidplayer.

Only sidgen.pl is required to generate C64.html. However the List.js folder must also be copied into the Music folder of HVSC to enable searching and sorting.
